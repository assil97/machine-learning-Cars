# machine-learning-Cars

I have implemented Machine Learning Concept to predict the mileage of the car where the weight, displacement, horsepower and cylinders of the car are given in the input.

I have used two models which are

  * Gradient Descent Regressor
    1. It is available in the file Untitled.ipynb
    
  * Random Forest Tree Regressor
    1. It is available in the file Car Prediction using Random Forest.ipynb
